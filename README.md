LAB 2B Expansion Board Proposal

# Plan Outline

This program aims to light 2 different LEDs based on the character input by the user. On pressing the key " C " , the green LED starts blinking , and the blue LED blinks upon pressing the key " D". The ```SCL1``` pin of the **QTPy RP2040** is connected to the ```GPIO23``` pin and the ```SDA1``` pin is connected to the ```GPIO22``` pin.
